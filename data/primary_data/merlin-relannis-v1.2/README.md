The initial relANNIS version 1.0 was converted from PAULA XML version 1.0.
Versions 1.0.1, 1.1.1 and 1.2 added/changed corpus meta data, changed the
corpus name and fixed the examples queries. The core data has stayed the same
since version 1.0.

## Description

The MERLIN corpus is a written learner corpus for Czech, German, and 
Italian that has been designed to illustrate the Common European 
Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) with authentic learner data. 
The corpus contains learner texts produced in standardized language 
certifications covering CEFR levels A1-C1. The MERLIN annotation scheme 
includes a wide range of language characteristics that provide 
researchers with concrete examples of learner performance and progress 
across multiple proficiency levels.
