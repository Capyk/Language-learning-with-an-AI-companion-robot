# Language-learning-with-an-AI-companion-robot
This project aims to combat the isolation and difficulty of language learning by building a smart AI companion robot (Pepper). Key steps include controlling the robot, implementing generative AI models for teaching, optimizing human-AI interaction, and evaluating the novel system's effectiveness in terms of user experience and learning outcomes.
